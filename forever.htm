    <p>
      My love, I don't know what tomorrow holds â€” but I know who I want to face it with.  
      You. Always you.  
      I promise to keep choosing you every day, in every way, for the rest of our lives.  

      Thank you for being my person, my peace, my forever.  
      This is not just a website. This is a piece of my heart, wrapped up in pixels and words,  
      meant only for the love of my life.  

      Forever yours,<br>
      With all my love.
