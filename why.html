    <h1>Why I Love You</h1>
    <p>
      Since the day you entered my life, everything changed.  
      I found a kind of peace in your presence I never knew I was searching for.  
      The way you talk, the way you laugh, the way you care — it all feels like home.  

      You taught me how to love more deeply, how to be patient, how to truly connect.  
      Even the simplest moments with you — a message, a smile, a memory — have become treasures I carry in my heart.  
      I don’t just love you for what you do, I love you for who you are — kind, beautiful, strong, and simply magical.
